## Relationships
- **Nier**
    - Good friends with Nier.
    - Garrick witnessed Nier help **Violet Depraysie**, younger sibling to **Finn Depraysie**, prevent her potion from exploding. Having been pranked and embarressed in the past
    by Nier, he was surprised by this. This, helped Garrick and Nier become fast friends, as Nier then helped Garrick pass potions last year. They started to hang out a lot
    and Nier was at Garricks place all the time over the summer. 
- **Callista**
    - Good friends with Callista, who stood up for him when **Tate Dukes** claimed that Garrick stole from him, and started a rumor that he is a theif
    and trouble maker, and has a stash of stolen things around the school. Which is why he has been held back.
    - Callista often drags Garrick into doing things outside of his comfort zone, since he is rather timid and Callista is quite competative.
- **Quinn**
    -Good friends with Quinn.
    -Quinn covered up for Garrick once when he told the teacher his homework was eaten by a **Snarglefluff**. The teacher didn't believe him, however Quinn pointed out
    that **Snarglefluff's** do love to eat paper.
    -Garrick often distract's quinn during class, messing about with his familar, a fat flying squirrel, changing it colors during class, and slacking off.
