## Relationships
- **Nier**
    - Met briefly, bonded over eachother both having a fox as a familiar.
- **Garrick Burgess** 
    - Friends with Garrick. Callista thinks that Garrick is more capable than he lets on, as well as street smarts etc.
    - Doesn't believe the rumors going around that he is a theif, and he's been kept behind because he's a theif and has a secret
    stash of stuff that he's stolen from other kids / the school. Troublemaker etc. Rumor started by **Tate Dukes**, who claims that Garrick stole 
    from him. 
- **Quinn**
    - Callista and Quinn are good friends. They have a secret hideout that they found in the school. 
    - Callista followed Quinn into the woods where they discovered Quinn meeting with a **Lunar Moth**. Knows Quinn's secret of finding this creature.
    - Feels guilty about following Quinn and discovering her secret, though Quinn doesn't know.


## Family
- Mom?
- Dad?
- Siblings?

- Family is generation of witches and wizards that have lived here / been apart of the coven
- Each generation known for having birds as their familiars
- They are the first in their family to have a fox familar. Kind of the oddball of the family
- Maybe this is a representation of how they are different than their family. Magically more in tune with Charm then Flight unlike
the rest of their family.
