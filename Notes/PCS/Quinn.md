    - Family crest / brooch thingy. Her name can help / hinder in certain situations
    - can hold this over certain peeps?
- What do you believe in that no one else seems to?
    - Most “absurd” things. I want to believe that the world is full of possibility - especially when it comes to all the unrecognized creatures and beings roaming our realm.
 - What would it mean to find someone who believes you?
    - Believing the things I do and feeling as strongly as I do about them - I rarely show it, but it makes me feel lonely. Especially because my own family rejects something that means so much. Having someone who believes me would remind me that i’m not alone, and it truly does mean a lot.

## Relationships
- **Nier**
    - Knows of Nier, mainly through his charming prankster / comedic nature around school. 
- **Garrick**
    - Good Friends with Garrick. Garrick helped her out once, when she got lost in the woods on an assignment, near a forbidden part of the forest, near the **Oblivion Well**. This was around when she discovered the **Lunar Moth**. But Garrick didn't see it. 
    (Maybe this is where she originally the existence of this special creature.) Garrick found her, and helped her back to the school.
    - Garrick is often distracting Quinn, with his slacker like nature, in class / when they are paired up. 
- **Callista**
    - Quinn learned of the secret hideout in which she and Callista like to hang out at, from her **Aunt**. 
    -She doesn't know that Callista knows her secret that a Lunar moth revealed itself to her. Known only to be seen in times of great tragedies or drawn to places where great tragedy occurred. Though the only people who have ever seen them seemingly were mad.  So they are widely believed to be folktale and rambling. Learned about them from her aunt, who is also kind of eccentric. Found near the **Oblivion Well** when she was on an assignment and got lost near there.
    - Callista was dared to stay the night at the **Wizzatoe Tower** and was planning to do so after the first week of school. Quinn doesn't want her to go through with it
    because it is dangerously haunted, and the anniversary of the first disappearance 100 years ago is approaching.
