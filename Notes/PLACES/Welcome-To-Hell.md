# Hell MI

## History
The Aurora Circle Coven came to this location in the Early 1800s

The location was found by **Umbriel Agathe** as she was very learned 
in the ways of tracking magical ley lines. She found that the veil was
particularly thin here, as a result it was the perfect location for a place 
of learning. TO hone and teach new young adepts so that they may become upstanding 
members of the coven or leave forge their own covens/destinies

Thus the **Wizzatoe Academy of Magical Arts** was founded, and a tower was constructed on
an island in the middle of a lake now known as **Wizzatoe Island** Additional Buildings for
the school were constructed on the island surrounding the tower. The school, tower and island
were glamored, and magic was practiced in secret to the nearby farmers and spare few folk that 
had inhabited the outlying lands.

In the 1830s **George Reeves** Moved to the area from the Catskill Mountains in New York. 
He was neither witch nor wizard and in 1841 he purchased a sawmill on what is now known as
Hell Creek. In addition he purchased 1000 acres of land surrounding the mill. Which in turn
grew into a thriving distillery business, and thus the small town of Hell was settled.

This caused issues for the school and made it harder to hide the magic that was being practiced 
under the very nose of the non magic townsfolk. At the time Umbriel was romantically involved with 
another founding witch of the coven. **Titania Blackwood**. Titania did not think much of non magic folk. 
The farmers she left well enough alone. But this "uppity businessman from the city would not meddle in 
the greater affairs of witches."

In the years following the American Civil War, even more scrutiny was brought towards hell, with US
tax collectors coming to hell wanting a piece of Reeves ever growing distillery business. This was
the last straw for Titania and she thought if this business and Reeves were no more, than there 
would be no further investigation, and no further risk to the school being found. 

She planned to kill Reeves and destroy his business, in an attempt to do so Umbriel tried to stop her
amongst the struggle Reeves discovered the two of them fighting with powers above his understanding.
In the chaos Reeves was able to hide and followed them back to the school. He soon fled
to amass a mob and form a witchhunt.

The entire town marched upon the Wizzatoe tower. Capturing a number of young witches and wizards, they
forced them into a number of whiskey barrells and sunk them to the bottom of the millpond. In a rage Titania
killed a number of townsfolk before the rest of the coven stopped her. As a group they modified the memories
(normally forbidden) of the townsfolk.

Umbriel and the other coven leaders then worked their magic to destroy the remaining parts of the school
creating the **Oblivion Well** a deep and endless pool of dark water, to which they sent the school and
excommunicated Titania. The well would be her prison, and contain her powers.

All that remained was an old abandoned water tower on Wizzatoe Island. Rumored to be haunted the townsfolk
kept astray from it. The town went back to normal, and the coven decided to move to a more secluded space, 
away from the town. They moved to a deep part of the woulds west of the town and glamored the area. Several
members of the coven integrated within the town and they worked to have the area become part of the 
**Pinckney Recreational Area**. To prevent further moving in. Since then it has been kept a great secret 
from those non magic and the members of the coven are fully integrated in the town and surrounding areas.

IN 1912 a riot described by many as the worst riot in history took place at Jackson State Prison. It is rumored that during the chaos one such prisoner escaped and fled towards Hell. It's even rumored by the school at the time, that it was a  warlock of some kind. 
Warlock named **Bencis Rathmore**, fled to hell and has been hiding out in the old abondoned tower ever since. Some times glamours himself to be an old homeless man around town. He came here, because he is infact an apprentice of **Titania Blackwood** they had worked together in the past, and he had heard of what happened. He was not a great person and got prisoned at some point, but in an attempt to hide his magic went along with it until he had the chance to escape. He wants to find a way to get her out. Has been working on it ever since.

In 1920, 100 Years ago, a young student named **Dante Norwood** snuck into the old Wizzatoe Tower as a dare because the tower had become known to be haunted. He was never seen again. Thus the rumor evolved, and it is now said that the tower is haunted by his spirit. But in fact he was killed By **Bencis Rathmore** in order to keep his staying in the tower secret. 


## Today

The Wizzatoe Academy of Arts is a school of the Magical Arts, teaching and honing the young
witches and wizards of Hell, MI and surrounding areas. To prepare them for a thier futures

of magical study, whatever it may be.

The school is lead by **Umbriel Agathe** High Priestess of the **Aurora Circle Coven** and founder
to the school. Many of the schools students live right here, in Hell. Some may even work part time 
jobs at the local **Hell Hole Diner**, or serving ice cream to tourists at the **Creamatory** 
At **Screams, Ice cream of Hell**. But when they aren't humoring tourists who've come from far and wide
to server as mayor of hell for a day, they are practings the great and secret arts of magic. Beneath cover
of glamor and wood, they learn and grow.
