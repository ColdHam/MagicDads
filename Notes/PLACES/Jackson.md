## History

Jackson State Prison opened in 1839 and was the first prison in Michigan and held many prisoners throughout
the years and there were many transgressions. During one such transgression in 1926 a number
of prisoners escaped. It is rumored that one such prisoner was a warlock in hiding by the name of **Brencis Rathmore**.

It has been a rumor around Hell and the school for many years, that Rathmore escaped and fled towards Hell and 
was never caught. Whilst the other prisoners were all eventually found. He could even be amongst those inhabitants
of Hell to this day.
