# Hooks

Some hooks I've / am going to drop hints on
Most of these are connected, but it doesn't mean
the order that we discover / look into them needs to be set in stone.
In fact thats the cool part of this whole thing. Seeing the ways in which the 
players will look into these various mysteries etc and how what they find and 
in which order effects what they decide to do.

## Mystery: A Link to Murder
Mysterious Youtube links going out. Some one is being attacked in the video?
Who is attacking, whos being attacked? Who's sending these links.

## Mystery: The Haunted Water Tower
Also Dalila has been missing for a few days, did she go to the tower? Whats up
with that haunted tower anyways? Whos the kid that died in there 100 years ago?
What happened with all that?

## Mystery: Seek The Pale Moth
Theres a Lunar Moth out there that Quinn has definitely seen. Why is it here?
Is it a premonition? Is there some kind of tragedy fated to befall our small 
community?

## Mystery: Beneath Oblivion
Whats up with that spooky oblivion well thing anyways. Why is it there? Why is it forbidden?

## Mystery: Agonizing with Adelle
Who is Adelle really? Why does she haunt the bathrooms? Did something tragic happen to her?
She's obviously not really Adelle...right?

## Mystery: Dealing with Bullys
Tate seems to be a real dick bag. Why is he always starting rumors and giving people shit.
Especially with Garrick. Why did he start those rumors about Garrick.

## Mystery: The All Seeing Comic Book
Apparently Dean's got this comic book that sees the future? Is it really the book? or is it him?
Where'd he get it?



Who knows what else? When in doubt ask the players questions. They could totally be 
invested in something else entirely / decide something else is more important. In which 
case we can switch gears. The story stuff we came up with is still intact regardless
and we can swap stuff around if need be.
