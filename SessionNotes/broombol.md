# Broombol

Broombole is a sport where the players ride brooms, and use brooms 

In a game of broombol there are two teams, each consisting of six players: two goaltenders and four others. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opponent. Goals are scored by hitting the ball into the opponent's varied corn hole ramps using the broom, whilst riding a broom theirselves. 

Unlike Broom Ball, it is not played on ice, but played on a square pitch, in which there are 4 goals, one in each corner. 2 goaltenders from each team manage each of their 
sides corners. Whiles the remaining 4 players try to hit and pass square bean bags into the opponents cornhole ramps for a variety of points based on the point value of each 
ramp / circle

Typical game broken up into 3 periods. 

Kinda some elements of hacky sack too. Rule can't touch the beanbags with your hands...only your stick broom, your riding broom and any other part of your body can touch the bag.

different boards every time. With different balanced point values, based on how hard the of a goal it is.

randomized portals sometimes appear on the pitch as part of the enchantment on the field

Goalies defend the boards with their broom. Attackers pass back and forth / interference.

2 bean bags in the center at start, and re appear from a central portal in the center after being scored through a cornhole goal.
