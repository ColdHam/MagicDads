## Intro Scene. Music: The Hooded Man. Title Card: The Wizzatoe Academy of Magical Arts.
Camera fades from black, closing in on the large trunk of a tree. Out of focus we can see many other trees 
surrounding us. A faint glow is coming from some sort of rune carved into this tree acts as the only light
in an otherwise darkened surrounding.

We see a a pale fist sized moth come walking across the rune, as it flashes the moth flutters away and the camera
follows it as it flies towards the forest ceiling. Moonlight shines through the dense coverage of trees as it 
breaks into the clear starry night sky. 

The camera cuts and we see a moths eye view of the forest as it flies accross the sky. The music swells
as we pan across a large stretching forest. Continuing across the sky we see a clearing in the trees, down
below is a large glassy lake, almost perfectly circular as it reflects a shimerring image of a full moon.

The camera cuts again and we see an old abandoned water tower in the distance. The moth continues towards the tower as it slowly begins to descend
we see the tower more close up we the large Red Letters "W" "I" "Z" before the camera continues to move following the moth down towards the lights 
of a small town. The camera pans across the village, following the moth from behind as it flys towards the village.

SPLAT! The music abruptly stops, A car comes into frame as the moth splats across the windshield leaving a gruesome smear
**Runnin' with the Devil by Van Halen** starts playing. A Black Chevrolet Impala Hardtop continues speeding along a dark road towards the lights of the village. the windshield wipers
begin to smear the remains of the moth across the windshield. 
THe car comes around the corner and slows to a near halt, as it turns into a near by parking lot passing a blue sign, as the car leaves frame we see the sign...

IF IT'S PURE MICHIGAN
WELCOME TO PURE HELL
Est 1841
Michigan's Hysterical Town

## Events

- She walks into the bar, inquiring at the front, and then proceeding toward the back of the bar towards a restroom sign. She walks up to the sign and we see the sign. GO TO HELL <--HIS / HERS --> and the witch crossing sign
- a smile flashes beneath her darkend hood and she steps towards the hers sign. Inside the bathroom she glances around, seeing no one else inside the bathroom she takes off her hood revealing her face. Her hair is bubble gum pink and 
braided in various knots. She uses her hand and swipes along the mirror almost as if its a tablet of some kind, and as she does her hair changes. She settles upon a bright orange mohawk both left and right sides of her head completely shaven.

# Session 2 8/28/20

# HouseKeeping
- Talk about adversity tokens
- how they can use them. 
    - Callista: 3
    - Garrick: 1
    - Nier: 1
    - Quinn: 1

- Explain about snap decisions vs normal planned rolls again

- In the lunchroom. Finish class. What they wanna do about this mysterious link? 

- What they wanna do about Dalila not showing up to school? 

- Teacher of Numerology / Runes Could be helpful? Marden Graves.

- Teachers don't know anything about Delila for the most part / Keeping things quiet. **Bullshit Out of town excuse. Maybe Family emergency or some shit?** Parents are working with the coven to try and find her / regular cops to be on the look out.
Not been publically announced of her dissappearance. 

- If the players can decipher the message furhter/ they might be able to discover a way to communicate with the other side.

- Through communication with ghost they might learn about the tower / go to the tower / find the phone / help the ghost. Also Callista will remember that they were talking 
about the curse of the tower / Dalila was really wanting to check it out / daring Callista to go with her.

- With a high enough brains roll Quinn would remember that one of the flashes she got with communicating with the Lunar Moth would be a quick flash of the Wizzatoe Tower

- Possible NPC encounters: Tates Being an ass. Or maybe Finn getting up to no good. 

- What Motivations / Fears can I play with?
    - Callista : Fail those close to them? (Dalila, Maybe can also use this with Tates being a bully to Garrick or Quinn). Prove that they are more than a sidekick. Be the hero. Save the girl. Obv

    - Garrick. Motivate him by giving him ways to help his friends, though this also comes in line with his fear, of his potential being seen.

    - Nier. Push him to show that he has what it takes to be an auramancer one day. Challenge him with peoples expectations of him. Also Give him excuses to bring out his inner prankser nature. The lake it be scary.

    - Quinn. Obviously anything that might lead to info about the moth / what it was trying to tell her. Fear is tough... basically family related matters. Might think about reworking this fear.

- Finish out school day. What do they wanna do?



# Session 3 9/13/20
- What do they do with this new info? Who is Dante?
- Continuing to communicate with Dante, might help learn some more info. **DC 11+ Charm check**.
- Dante is not great at interpreting / communicating through the possession of the device...which is apart of the issue. Through more communication / research on Dante, they might be able to figure out that he died / is a ghost 
- Library research **DC 13+ Mind check for research in the library/online**
- Maybe even learn more about his death and that its linked to the tower? Which could lead them to going to the tower. Also they might learn that he's possesed a phone and that is how he is communicating.

- Maybe some school kid bs, with Tate wanting to start some shit? **Tate bullying Garrick.**  Finn's new Vape pen is missing magically? Tate blames Garrick as usual. Finn doesn't believe that shit. Finn thinks there is definitely something fishy going on though...lots of kids lost items last year, but who knows.

- See some broombol action...Fosho. Do we see Callista try and teach / help Nier or Garrick? Do they try out for the team?
- If so well have some Broombol tryouts? See what **Kane** thinks of that!

- If they end up deciding that the tower is their next / best lead, then we will probably jump to the weekend when they can have some time to look into that. In the mean time, figure out anything else they may have done in preperation etc.
- Adelle Cromwell might be able to help with some info / also being a ghost and all...if/once they figure out that dean is a ghost?
- Either way this could lead to them going to the tower, in search of the ghost. Do they trust him or not? The tower is much larger on the inside and maze like.
- Puzzles etc?
- Definitley A potion related riddle
- Spoider!



# Session 4 9/25/2020
The week goes by feels mundane and slow with the looming mystery that lies before them and the anticipated weekend 
in which they may be able to find out more.

How do they plan to get to the tower. What they do may result in attention. What kind of attention may they draw?
- Non magic folk seeing magic is a big no no. Def the kind of attention they dont want to bring.
- The attention of higher members of the order / magical law enforcement. Could also be uhohs.
- Fellow students? / Teachers? Keep their plans quiet?
- Their parents? What are they telling them? / How are they keeping out of trouble

- Theres definitely a neighboring house near the lake that has a deck /w a boat. This could be a way? Pretty high dc to sneak that bad boi out. lol.
- brooms? this one is dangerous for the non magic folk
- swim? spoooookey. 
- **DEFINITELY A GREAT PLACE FOR CHECKS**

- Are they going to go in the middle of the day? or night?

- If they get there, its seems to be nothing but an old abandoned water tower.

- The island is heavily forrested. Spooky Forrest. **Some kind of check for finding their way?** Maybe some animals / noises.

- Old wooden water tower Stands alone in the middle of the island deep within the forest. Seemingly inocuous. Creaky wooden staircase climbs the tower to the very top. At the top is a an opening into the tower. Its dark and dank smelling within the body of the tower, where the water would be kept. Large wooden letters carved into the tower, "Wizzatoe" Within the O is a small carving of the aruroa circle as well as a number of moon runes. **dc 10 mind check** unless they have the poem in which case they know where to look.

- A small structure is built out of the base of the tower, with a wooden door that is seemingly nailed shut. Upon entering the structure it is small, and dark and dusty. A small 
room lies before you a table with a number of papers detailing the water tower building, an old cot, table and chair. a set of wooden stairs spirals around the outside of the room towards another room up stairs. Room seems to have had recent use / dust is slightly unsettled.

- Following these stairs as they creak and groan, will lead them to another room above similarly lit. Dark and dank. This is the room of the video. A large book case leans against the wall Books and papers lie scattered. A **dc 7+ mind check** will uncover some papers with writings about the full moon.

` In Darkest Night with Moon so Bright `
` Reveal Thine Secrets Left Behind `
` Within the O doth Shall Glow `
` Only open to those of our kind `

- A successful ritual / spell of revealing, can allow them to "enter the glamor" and see the building for what it really is. However this particular glamor requires the light
of the full moon. +3 (Person or Smaller) +1 (a few minutes) +5 (Reality Bending) +3 (Witnessed) For a total of **DC12** However any attempt at this without the light of the moon
even a success will have no effect. Give them a chance to come to this conclusion **DC8 mind** for hints / ideas


- The tower is a massive stone and brick building, cylindrical and rising high into the sky. There are large iron doors that will open at a simple unlocking spell. 
- The tower has spiraling stair cases both leading downward and upward. Down below are a number of classrooms and a deep cellar. Potions etc were brewed here.
- there are whispers and various odd noises coming from random class rooms / doors. Seems very haunted.
- Towards the top are a number of rooms with doors along the side walls of the tower seemingly leading no where? Stair case ends in a single door. Its locked, and cannot be opened no matter what spell is thrown at it. There is an engraving of a potion bottle upon the door.
- Down in the potions area is where the potion puzzle is. Solving the potion puzzle will give them what they need to pass the door.

Got a bunch of weird rooms in the tower. Can improvise with whats going on there. 

Down
The Blue Lichen Room
    - Home to a largely overgrown species of bioluminescent lichen. The lichen humbs with electricity and can be lethal to the touch. A ruby gem lies in the middle of the room
The Tapestry Room
    - Tapestry room, not much to this room. lightly furnished, old classroom. Behind a tapestry lies a beautfiul incomplete bust of titania.
The Chest Room
    - A chest lies in the middle of the room. It is animated and will attack if tried to be opened. "MIMIC" ITSA TRAP
The Potion Room
    - The potion riddle
    
Up
The Summoning Room
    - Summoning room. Brenthis has been doing experiments here. Trying to summon ghosts and things etc. Working towards summoning Titania?
    - If the circle is activated it might summon a ghost from the lake?
The Water Pillar Room
    - Water pillar, mainly an unlimited source of water, conjured into this room so that it can be used. For a variety of things.
The Mirror Room
    - Who knows why this room exists. But it definitely has a few "pets" that Brencis has befriended.
The Illusion Room
    - Brencis has taken this room to be his place of lodging. Very fancy.
